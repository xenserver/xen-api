(** Check the pool for PVS cache SRs which are
    a) visible to the specified host
    b) listed as cache storage for the specified PVS farm.

    Returns
      Some (sr, Some vdi)
      - if there is an SR available with a cache VDI
      Some (sr, None)
      - if there is an SR available with no cache VDI
      None
      - if there is no SR available

    If multiple SRs are available, the algorithm will firstly prefer SRs which
    already contain cache VDIs, and secondly will prefer SRs with
    lexicographically lower UUIDs. *)
